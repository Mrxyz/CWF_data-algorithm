# Code With FGG - Backend Development and Algorithm

## Description
In the fast-paced world of modern life, it can be time-consuming to do data processing work. A teacher is anxious to fill out a form of student information. Fortunately, you can help him to build a system to deal with those data. Now, get to work!

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repo to your branch.
2. Start to code in your forked branch.
3. Create a PR to us after your work is done.

## What do you have in the repository

A text format dataset named info.txt contains the student info collected from teachers.

## What you have to do

* Build an API which receives the text file and returns the structured data.

For example:
```
Output:
[
{
    "name": "吴轩忆",
    "sex": "女",
    "年龄”: 8,
    "年级": 3,
    "班级": 2,
    "优秀科目": ["语文", "数学", "英语"],
    "班主任": "李芳",
    "年级排名": 8
}
...
]
```

* Build an API for analyzing the ranking, returning the best class.


## What are we expecting

* Knowledge of Git.
* The capacity of backend development.
* Unique understanding of data science.
* Clear logic of text processing.
* Readable Code.

## Hint

* Feel free to use any backend framework, such as Flask, Egg.js, Spring, etc.
* The standard of the best class is up to you. Thus, you can choose any feature to score a student.
* The result data will probably import to a NoSQL DB. You'd better prepare this work.
